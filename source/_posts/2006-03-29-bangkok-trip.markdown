At 2:30PM on Mar 24, 2006, I was in the ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/airplane.gif) from Macau to BangKok.  I was going to have a three-days' trip in BangKok with some colleagues.  This was a company event rewarding the staffs worked for one year.




 




This is not the first time I took ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/airplane.gif), but the first time I crossed my country's boundary.  At the end of the three-hours' ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/airplane.gif), our ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/airplane.gif) kept cycling in the sky for five times.  Maybe the airport had no place to let it land on at that time, but it was really a signal indicating an unforgetable trip.




 




We finally had our dinner at 7:00PM that night.  We all were like starving wolfs.  Although the Thai food was a little spicy, it was very delicious.  Especially the fruit, the pineapple, watermelon, were as sweet as sugar.  Our table had had 3 dishes.![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_shades.gif)  We had tried our best to tasted and finished all the courses.  However, there were too many dishes to eat them all.




 




The hotel is really wonderful.  This was the first time I stayed in five-star hotel.  The room is clean, comfortable and has necessary facilities.  However, it has one strange design that the bath room and the main room is separated by glass and shutter.  That means people outside the bath room can see the inside of the bathroom!  I still can't understand it.




 




The meals, activities during this trip were great, especially the breakfast in the hotel and the night show (SIAM NIRAMIT).  The night show is Thai's traditional dancing.  We watched it in a beautiful decorated hall.  The lights, scenes, dancing were fantastic.  It is much much better than the Renyao show.




 




Another unforgettable thing is the Thai Massage we had.  Before being massaged by the Massage people, I was very afraid to die in the joints twisting.  However, I really wanted to had it another time after massage.  Although it's a little ached during their pressing and twisting, the massage people really got to the points where your muscle and joints are tight.  You will feel kind of released and light after massage.  I just think it would be great if I can have Thai massage while I am working.  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif)




 




The last unbelievable and unforgettable thing is how crazy the HK colleagues can be.  At the second night in the hotel, I was invited to have a drink with some HK colleagues.  Playing games and drinking wine, we gradually became a little drunk and crazy.  We drank, tried every means to wake up other colleagues and wandered in hotel.  I can't believe how I could do that but I actually did it.  **_When play, play crazily; when work, work hard._**  I can finally feel that after that night.  When will another crazy night come?  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_teeth.gif)




 




There were two small add-ons at the end of this trip.  One is that I left my worn clothes in the travel bus and realized this in the plane back to Macau from BangKok!![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_confused.gif)  Luckily the HK colleagues found it and bring them back to me.![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_embaressed.gif)  The other one is that it's required to pay extra money if we use the luggage case in taxi.  We knew that after being cheated by one taxi driver in Macau.![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_angry.gif)  We in fact didn't have much luggage and didn't need to put them there.




 




This BangKok is also a UAT - unforgettable, adorable and treasurable.  I am looking forward for another one next year.
