On Sep 23rd, 2005 morning 8:00 AM, I was in the bus way to Yang Chun with Winnie's family, indicating the beginning of the travel to Da Jiao Wan.




 




This travel is the first long-distance one planned by us.  In fact, it's mostly planned by Winnie because most of the contact and booking was handled by her.  What a shame!  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_embaressed.gif)  I have to plan for our next trip.




 




We have been to Da Jiao Wan at noon and have had a nap in the hotel after one seafood meal.  Can you bellieve that a standard double room only costs 100 RMB one night?  Again, Winnie made this bargain.  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_teeth.gif)  You may wonder why we waste several hours on sleeping, but WHO swims at noon!  What is more, the 4 hours' bus trip makes most of us tired, but me.  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_shades.gif)




 




 Anyway, we went to the seashore and planned to swim at about 4PM.  Because the typhoon "Da Wei" was approaching Yang Jiang, it's cloudy and the sea had not small wave.  Again, my dream ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/island.gif) that in the ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/sun.gif), I lay on a hammock under two coconut trees by the blue and lucid ocean, having a ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/coffee.gif) nearby, and some little crabs creep on the soft seashore on which colorful shells lying didn't come true.  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_confused.gif)




 




 Even though that was not exactly my dreamy ocean, I was still very excited to see it and could "swim" in it.  "Swim"  is quoted here because technically I only floated with the help of the life buoy instead of swimmed. ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif)  On the one hand, I admit that my swiming ability is not good enough to swim in the ocean.  On the other hand, you know, the typhoon "Da Wei" was approaching and the sea had "big" waves.  At that time, I could really feel the unlimited power of the ocean.  No wonder the latest tsunami in Indian Ocean caused that kind of disaster and dilapidation.   Suddently, I feel that I am so small in this planet, in this universe.  Praying......




To enjoy my life!  Eager for my next wonder trip!![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/lightbulb.gif)
