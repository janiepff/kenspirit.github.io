During this mother's day, Winnie & I had a great vacation with my mom and dad.




 




**1st Destination:**




We had a one day Macau tour on May 12th.  This was the first tour for my family.  When I was still in school, we have never go somewhere.  What is more, my dad prefers watching TV than going out.  He can lay on the sofa all day without moving! ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_confused.gif)  If this trip hasn't been planned to go gambling in Casino Lisboa in Macau.  I guess he would probably not coming to ZH.




 




Anyway, We arrived at Macau around 11AM.  My mom didn't feel very well because of bus-sick and Vomiting serveral times.  (FYI.  It tooks about 3 hours from Huizhou to Zhuhai;  It tooks about 1 hour from where I live to the Customs between Zhuhai and Macau).  We quickly find a place for lunch first so that my mom can have a rest.  After lunch (noodle & pork bread), we went sight-seeing around Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro (亞美打利庇？大馬路), Senado Square (議事亭前地), Rua de S. Paulo(大三巴街), Fortaleza do Monte Monte Fortress(大炮台).




 




About 4:30PM, we decided to go to the Casino Lisboa.  I think my dad has already waited such a long time for this moment came.  Before entering the casino, we made a decision that we have to enter the casino through back door in order to win.![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif)  I have exchanged 4 chips (100MOP each) to play "big & small".  2 chips for my dad, 1 for my mom and 1 for winnie.




 




Why none for me?  Because I always believe that I have no this kind of luck for gambling.  You don't believe?  Let me tell you this.  For the first round, we all had no idea what to bet and then winnie decided to took the first step for us.  She asked me, "what do you bet?  Big or small?".  I thought for a while and said, "Big."  Then winnie said loudly, "OK, I bet small" and put 1 chip at the side for small.  I was stun by her.  "Ding, ding, ding", desk clear and nobody was allowed to change anymore.  "Small!!"  Can you feel what my feeling at that time?![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_confused.gif)  To be angry, or to be happy?  haha, both.




 




After that, my mom and dad became active and discussed with winnie about what should bet next.  Another unbelievable thing is when I asked my dad to take a shot and try, but he said no, it's better to let your mom gamble, she's more lucky than me.  Can you believe it?  I can't!  The one who want to gamble most doesn't gamble after he's there.![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif)




 




At the end, we counted the chips and found that winnie won 350MOP, my mom won 100MOP, and my dad won 200MOP.  Haha, we won a free trip to Macau.




 







**2nd Destination:**




After a busy day in Macau, we felt very tired and slept until 9AM on the next morning.  The next day's destination is the imperial-hotspring in order to take a rest.   But it's about 2 hours car from my dorm.  It would more than 3 hours if we take the bus.




 




We decided to go to Wanzi to have a seafood lunch and shop for dried seafood first.  You have to respect my mom's bargain ability.  We only use 350RMB to buy several bags of those stuffs.  Besides, I still have to thank Cindy to introduce her familiar supplier to me so that we can get lower price.




 




After buying the dried seafood, we bought the fresh seafood for our lunch.  This time, the seafood is not as cheap as before, maybe near the Fishing moratorium duration.  But we tried something new, the Sea urchins.  You can take a look at the picture of its shell after I have done with it.![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif)




 




We arrived the hotspring after lunch.  Nothing special.  Just one word:"Relax".




 




Ending:




I lost about 2000RMB during this trip.  But for 4 people, it's not expensive indeed.  What is more, it's quite worthy because I can have such a great time with my parent.  I will make more money and go to other places with them!!  Yeah!.




 




After words - A strange phenomenon: my mom didn't feel bus-sick and vomit anymore after winning in Casino.  haha![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_teeth.gif)
