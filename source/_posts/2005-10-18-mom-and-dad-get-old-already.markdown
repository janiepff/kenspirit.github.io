**Suddenly**, I feel that my dear mom and dad get older already.  I didn't have this feeling before because they look young and I heard almost no sickness news from them.  However, this is not always the truth.




 




A bad news that my mom suffers an aura of one terrible disease brought me back to the reality on last Friday.  I was stun at that moment.  I can't believe that at all because she lives a quite disciplinary life:  sleep early, get up early and jog, and dance with some friends at night.  




 




However, she has a lot of work to do as our family's master.  She does the cooking, laundries, cleaning everyday and she has to take care of dad, her parents, me and almost all relatives.  I know she's carrying too many responsibilities but I can't help her much.  The only thing I can do is to be her good boy, to be healthier so that she doesn't need to worry about me, to be excellent to make her proud of me, to save more money so that I can give her some, to buy some gifts to make her happy, to have a talk with her about once a month...




 




Suddenly, to me, what I have done seems so minor in front of this.  I can't imagine my life without her.  I am feared to think about that.  I feel that I can do nothing now.  I can just support her and try my best to make her happy and stay with her when free.




 




Her symptom and condition is not that bad now but already make us feel the darkness even though we don't want to.  She had insomnia and black eyes these days.  Although she also told me that it should be OK and I know that is also what she is trying to console herself with, I can still feel her fear inside.  However, I know she is strong enough to fight with that disease and can finally win it with our support and good wishes.




 




One doesn't feel the pain until he's the victim.  I can finally feel that my parents get old already and I have done so little for them.  Now I only hope my mom can recover soon and be happy and healthy again.
