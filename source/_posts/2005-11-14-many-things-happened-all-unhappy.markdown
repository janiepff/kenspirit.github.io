In this shortly two months, many unhappy things happened around me.  Actually, I can't say those are all unhappy.  They just made me worried and greatly drew my attention.




 




In fact, these "unhappy" things were all about the healthy condition of the ones I love and myself.  Suddenly, I realize that health is very important, but because of many kinds of reasons (endeavor to work, neglect, unwareness, etc.), its prominent role slips down to almost the most trivial one.  I think this was just the time it showed its anger and irritation.  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_tongue.gif)




 




Bear its announcement in mind, I will pay attention to my health and remind my friends & relatives more.  It's always easier to cure an disease at the most earliest stage.




 




In point of fact, it's quite lucky that these "unhappy" things happened.  Some diseases are discovered at the first stage before it get worse;  those made me alert to the importance of the body condition and more mature.  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_wink.gif)




 




 




Wish everybody healthy and happy.  ![](http://spaces.msn.com/rte/emoticons/smile_party.gif)
