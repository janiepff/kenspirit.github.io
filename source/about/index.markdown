My Name is Ken Chen.

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17182499/blog/logo_medium.png)

I keep learning to be a good father, husband, son and web developer.

I am particularly interested in the languages which have first-class functions.  Javascript is my current choice as it's closed to my job.  Node.JS, MongoDB and AngularJS are my play toys now.  Lisp looks fun too.  I think I would look into Clojure later.

Please free to get in touch with me using any of the method below.

##About this blog##
This blog has been started long time ago in the purpose of keeping track of myself.  
However, I haven't kept it well since 2006.  After certain age, I started to think (hard) what I want to be and how to achieve it.  I think it's the time to pick it up again and keep moving without stop.

I gain a lot from the community and hope some of the content here can also benefit you a little bit.
