My Name is Ken Chen.

![](http://thinkingincrowd.u.qiniudn.com/logo_medium.png)

On the road to be a good father, husband, son and web developer, specialized in JS.

It's been 7 years before I decided to dive into JS.
I love the languages which have first-class functions.
I am playing with Node.JS, MongoDB and AngularJS and hope one day I can build my dream application.

Feel free to get in touch with me using any of the method below.

##About this blog##
This blog has been started long time ago in the purpose of keeping track of myself.
However, I haven't kept it well since 2006.  After certain age, I started to think (hard) what I want to be and how to achieve it.  I think it's the time to pick it up again and keep moving without stop.

I gain a lot from the community and hope some of the content here can also benefit you a little bit.
