一直以来，我都不太喜欢 Management，而倾向于喜欢 Leadership 这个词。原因是我对那些单纯的命令或者军事性的管理嗤之以鼻，也认为那是对知识管理者的不恰当的方式。看过管理大师 Peter F. Drucker 的 Effective Executive 那本书后，对他的新时代管理方式的理念比较认同。

但是，仅仅因为我不喜欢旧的管理方式，其实我却把另一些无论是 Leadership 还是 Management 都要做的东西给忽略掉。最近看李笑来老师分绍的那本 [Management Pipeline][]，更是清楚自己缺失了什么。在整个管理升级通道上，最底层的是从管理自己到管理他人的转变。这里也就主要讲讲这个我正在经历的阶段。

## 有什么改变

书中有一个很好的表格详细阐述了从个人贡献者到一个一线管理者在各个方面的变化。如下图：

      Performance measurement
      Coaching and Feedback
      Rewards and motivation
      Communication and climate setting
      Relationship building up, down, sideways for the units' benefits*

      vs

      Technical or professional proficiency
      Team play
      Relationship building for personal benefits, results
      Using company tools, processes and procedures

    Time Application
      Annual Planning - budgets, projects
      Making time available for subordinates - both at your requests or theirs
      Setting priority for unit and team
      Communication time with other units, customers, suppliers

      vs

      Daily Discipline
      Meeting personal due date for projects - usually short term by managing own time

    **Managers must cease thinking about themselves but start thinking about others**

    1. Defining and assigning work to be done, including communicating with the boss and others about needs or expectations, planning, organizing, choosing people, and delegating.

      * Figure out what needs to do and who needs to do
      * let go of work.  How to delegate, regular review, follow-up, problem solving, measurement, reward, coach
      * How to hire people with matched work style and beliefs of organization


    2. Enabling direct reports to do the work by monitoring, coaching, providing feedback, acquiring resources, problem solving, and communicating.

      Sign of clogged leadership pipeline is high stress among individual contributors.

      * View questions from his people as interruption
      * Fixes their mistakes rather than teaching them to do the work properly
      * Refuses to take the ownership of the success of his people, distancing himself from their problems and failure.

      * Pay attention.
        Monitoring what is getting done and how it's getting done.
        Ask questions about what is getting in the way of completing tasks effectively or what might facilitate the process.
        Pat on the back when the results are good and positive feedback
        Training, rescheduling, redesign of methods, and requests for more resources when the results are not so good.

      Be available.
        Much more of an attitude than an event

    3. Building social contracts through establishing relationships with direct reports, bosses, and support groups that facilitate open dialogues and trust.

      Primarily rooted in value.  Build trust and open lines of communication vertically and horizontally.

      * The Boss (Management Structure)
        Connecting with the larger management structure and understanding how it works.

      * Direct Reports
        Not about liking subordinates or socializing with them but about mutual respect and support.  First-line managers need to become accountable for the success of their subordinates (and vice versa).  Demonstrating personal integrity.

      * Suppliers, Customers and Other Relevant Individuals
      


  - How to do them

    1. Preparation: Clearly communicate the skills, time applications, and work values required at this passage and provide training that helps people make necessary change.

      * Individual contributors need to understand what's required of them in specific rather than general terms.

      * Important to go beyond skills.  First-line managers may not see a need for a shift in what they value;  skills applied without commitant values are not applied with enthusiasm, energy and innovation.

        Let the people go even if people have high results but low values.

      * Training is important

    2. Monitoring: Determining whether and where someone is having difficulty with his first transition

      * Observation: Sit in on first-line manager's interactions with their direct reports and determine whether they're exhibiting the skills leadership level requires.
        How others view the behavior and attitudes of first-time managers.  Direct report can provide insight.

      * Gap Analysis: Question first-time managers about their perceptions of their skills, time applications and values.  Contrast their answers with the observation and make them aware of the gap.

        Intervention: Provide regular feedback and coaching to help people make this transition.  There are many forms:

        - Coaching-Feedback
          No subsitute for one-to-one coaching from the first-time manager's boss.

        - Peer learning and Partnering

        - Meeting, reading and travel
          Talk about what they have learned in the meeting
          Assigned reading
          Traveling with boss

    3. New Work Assignment

      first-time manager need to practice and perfect their skills first.
