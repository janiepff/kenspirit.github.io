    **Managers must cease thinking about themselves but start thinking about others**

    1. Defining and assigning work to be done, including communicating with the boss and others about needs or expectations, planning, organizing, choosing people, and delegating.

      * Figure out what needs to do and who needs to do
      * let go of work.  How to delegate, regular review, follow-up, problem solving, measurement, reward, coach
      * How to hire people with matched work style and beliefs or organization


    2. Enabling direct reports to do the work by monitoring, coaching, providing feedback, acquiring resources, problem solving, and communicating.

      Sign of clogged leadership pipeline is high stress among individual contributors.

      * View questions from his people as interruption
      * Fixes their mistakes rather than teaching them to do the work properly
      * Refuses to take the ownership of the success of his people, distancing himself from their problems and failure.

      * Pay attention.
        Monitoring what is getting done and how it's getting done.
        Ask questions about what is getting in the way of completing tasks effectively or what might facilitate the process.
        Pat on the back when the results are good and positive feedback
        Training, rescheduling, redesign of methods, and requests for more resources when the results are not so good.

      Be available.
        Much more of an attitude than an event

    3. Building social contracts through establishing relationships with direct reports, bosses, and support groups that facilitate open dialogues and trust.

      Primarily rooted in value.  Build trust and open lines of communication vertically and horizontally.

      * The Boss (Management Structure)
        Connecting with the larger management structure and understanding how it works.

      * Direct Reports
        Not about liking subordinates or socializing with them but about mutual respect and support.  First-line managers need to become accountable for the success of their subordinates (and vice versa).  Demonstrating personal integrity.

      * Suppliers, Customers and Other Relevant Individuals

  - How to do them

    1. Preparation: Cleary communicate the skills, time applications, and work values required at this passage and provide training that helps people make necessary change.

      * Individual contributors need to understand what's required of them in specific rather than general terms.

      * Important to go beyond skills.  First-line managers may not see a need for a shift in what they value;  skills applied without commitant values are not applied with enthusiasm, energy and innovation.

        Let the people go even if people have high results but low values.

      * Training is important

    2. Monitoring: Determining whether and where someone is having difficulty with his first transition

      * Observation: Sit in on first-line manager's interactions with their direct reports and determine whether they're exhibiting the skills leadership level requires.
        How others view the behavior and attitudes of first-time managers.  Direct report can provide insight.

      * Gap Analysis: Question first-time managers about their perceptions of their skills, time applications and values.  Contrast theri answers with the observation and make them aware of the gap.

        Intervention: Provide regular feedback and coaching to help people make this transition.  There are many forms:

        - Coaching-Feedback
          No subsitute for one-to-one coaching from the first-time manager's boss.

        - Peer learning and Partnering

        - Meeting, reading and travel
          Talk about what they have learned in the meeting
          Assigned reading
          Traveling with boss

    3. New Work Assignment

      first-time manager need to practice and perfect their skills first.
